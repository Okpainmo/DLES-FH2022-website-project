        I am Joshua Okpanachi by name. I’m an undergraduate and a member of the
        Deeper Christian Life Ministry. I would like to talk about my experience
        at the ongoing DLES. DLES popularly known as Deeper Life
        Entrepreneurship School is a yearly programme organized by the Deeper
        Christian Life Ministry to empower youths; young adult and
        undergraduates to be independent, self-employed and successful
        entrepreneurs. I’ve heard several announcements from the church
        moderator and pastor concerning the programme and I was determined to
        attend. Boom! The programme started. I wasn’t present the first day. I
        was disappointed. It was time for Monday Bible study and members of the
        church were assembled at the church premises for the service. Later on.
        I met a brother who attended. The Day 1 of the DLES. He shared his view
        about the programme and he also informed me that a programmer came to
        church that day and did introduction on the basics of coding. I was
        propelled and motivated by his words and I told myself I won’t miss that
        of tomorrow. The next day came, I was present and we were taught stuffs
        ranging from education, counsel series, temperament and lot more. It was
        time for coding, I listened attentively as the programmer take us
        through an educative section of coding. We were taught the meaning, uses
        and methods of coding. More so, we were introduced into simple and
        common programming language like HTML, CSS and Java Script. The good
        part of it is that our coach [programmer] promised to take us through a
        free mentorship for coding if only we are interested. This year’s
        package of DLES was educative, inspiring, informative and power-packed
        as our spiritual lives were awakened. Indeed, I got value!
