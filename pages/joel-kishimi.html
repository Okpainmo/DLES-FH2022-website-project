        My name is Kishimi Joel AKA De-New-Kish-Joe. I am an undergraduate and a
        student of Federal Polytechnic Kaura Namoda, the Department of Food
        Technology I was privileged for the Deeper Life Entrepreneurship School
        [DLES 2022]. It was indeed an awesome experience, seeing myself being
        used by my maker to serve the purposes of the kingdom and to depopulate
        the kingdom of darkness and populate the kingdom of God by pulling the
        youth from the hand of the devil, breaking the yoke of addictions and
        helping them find purpose in life and destiny. Though, it was a huge
        sacrifice for me to shut down other activities for the past three weeks
        to always avail myself daily in the programme to teach the student but I
        count it as a great privilege to serve God in this capacity because it
        gives me great joy to see young boys and girls serving the purposes of
        the kingdom and walking in the fullness of their eternal ordination. I
        really appreciate the name of the Lord for the success of the DLES 2022
        to see Jesus revealed in the life of all the participants and to see
        Jesus glorified. I also want to thank God for the corporation of all the
        instruments God used in one way or the other to impact into the lives of
        the students [academics session, leadership session, youth series and
        creativity]. I want to use this medium to thank bro Andrew in particular
        for devoting his time and attention for more than a week coming to
        impact the life of the children to know the essence and importance of
        coding and digital marketing. May the Almighty God reward your labour of
        love. Finally, I will like to say thank you to all our group leaders and
        members from Federal Housing Group, Ungwan Tanko Group and Karatudu
        Hausa Group for their support and contribution in monetary terms for the
        success of the DLES 2022. May your labour of love never go unrewarded.
