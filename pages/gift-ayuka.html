        My name is Gift Ayuka. I am here to share some experience that I learnt
        in this very impact. First, I have learnt on things youth are supposed
        to do and things not to do. Our youth coordinators told us that no
        matter many obstacles on the way we should not give up. So many youths
        are living a sinful live and committing all manners of sin today. They
        taught us to obey elders and have respect for them. They have impacted
        so many things upon us. We should not be lazy we should be hard working
        many things they told us. And another thing is that we need to be
        baptized by the Holy Ghost. Sincerely, sinful life is not the best life
        to live. People think that sin is the best place to live but no! if you
        have Jesus you have everything. People think if you follow Jesus is very
        hard, no. Our leaders taught us Maths, English and some other important
        subject we need to know. Thanks for reading and thanks to our leaders
        who created time and taught us. May God help them in Jesus name, Amen.
