        Hi, my name is Davida Adeshina, telling you about my DLES 2022
        experience. The first time I came for the programme, I saw it wasn’t as
        lively as success camp so I thought “it’s not going to be interesting at
        all”. They taught English, Maths. We had leadership counsel sessions and
        coding class. It was actually interesting and I actually liked it, well,
        except for the part that we had to write tests. The youth counsel series
        help make a teachable moment for me but it was the leadership counsel
        sessions that taught me a very valuable lesson, for example, when we
        were talking about public speaking it helped me for the fact that I
        would be speaking as the new assistant head girl. It was an eye-opener
        for me and I hope it will be an eye-opener for others in Jesus name. P.s
        the coding was the most magnificent part of this programme which was
        very helpful
